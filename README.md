# Splitify - Splitwise Clone App

Splitify is a simplified, high-fidelity Splitwise-inspired application built for Spreetail's Software Engineering Intern assignment. It allows users to manage shared expenses, track group-wise and individual balances, resolve debts through a transaction minimization engine, and chat in real-time about specific expenses.

## 💻 Local Setup Instructions

### 1. Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed on your machine:
*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) (v18 or higher recommended)
*   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (installed automatically with Node)

### 2. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rajeev12R/Splitwise.git
cd Splitwise
```

### 3. Backend Setup
1.  Navigate to the backend directory:
    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```
2.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  Configure environment variables. Copy or rename the `.env` template and set your connection parameters:
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
    Inside `.env`, populate your PostgreSQL database connection string and secure token secret:
    ```env
    PORT=3000
    JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_signing_secret_here
    DATABASE_URL="postgresql://<username>:<password>@<host>:<port>/<db_name>?sslmode=require"
    ```
4.  Run Prisma migrations to create the database schemas:
    ```bash
    npx prisma db push
    ```
5.  Start the development server (runs nodemon for auto-reload):
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    The server will start on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### 4. Frontend Setup
1.  Open a new terminal session and navigate to the frontend directory:
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```
2.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  Configure environmental client endpoints by adding a `.env` file (Optional - defaults to local server):
    ```env
    VITE_API_URL="http://localhost:3000/api"
    VITE_SOCKET_URL="http://localhost:3000"
    ```
4.  Start the Vite dev server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    Open your browser and navigate to the local client dashboard at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).

## 🤖 AI Development Collaboration

This project was built in collaboration with **Gemini 3.5 Flash** (via the Antigravity Agentic IDE) acting as a junior developer.

*   **Role Constraints**: The AI was explicitly instructed not to assume requirements, to refrain from making technical recommendations without consultation, and to maintain `AI_CONTEXT.md` as the absolute source of truth.
*   **Documentation Flow**: Every product decision, database schema design, and UI route was documented in `AI_CONTEXT.md` before any implementation scripts were executed.
*   **Prompts Used**: Refer to [prompts/prompts.md](file:///Users/ranjan/splitwise/prompts/prompts.md) for the exact prompt contexts used to guide the development cycle.
